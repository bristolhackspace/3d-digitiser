Based on a project by [fablab.ruc.dk](http://fablab.ruc.dk/diy-digitizer/)

# Differences

The main difference was using [USDigital
A2](http://www.usdigital.com/products/a2) encoders, which were a lucky gift.
This changed the CAD (because they are bigger) and the software (because they
communicate over an RS485 bus and are absolute).
