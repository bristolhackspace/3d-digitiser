# software for the arduino

We used very nice [USDigital
A2](http://www.usdigital.com/products/a2) encoders, which were a lucky gift.

They had the best documentation I've probably ever used for a product;
including:

* [comms
 protocol](http://www.usdigital.com/support/user-guides/sei-absolute-encoder-communications-protocol)
* [bus
 specification](http://www.usdigital.com/support/user-guides/sei-serial-encoder-interface-bus)

Matt still needed a scope to get more than 2 working on a bus!
